yo this is actually kind of wild....

so this is going to be kind of a big project. which may honestly end up broken up into smaller portions that will make the project more modular. 

Welp this is it, this is the start of noanotherSandbox... what is it, you might ask, well this is going to be a general sandbox project in Unity that will likeyl be the playground
and birthplace of many other games and projects. If you've ever played games such as Boneworks by Stress Level Zero, or Garry's Mod by Garry Newman, then you will have a pretty good 
idea of what to expect when interacting with this project. 

Now that doesn't mean as of right now to be expecting a release of any kind any time soon. Right now this is going to be purely up to those who know what they
are doing to be able to make use of the things in this repo. I will be able to assist with as much as possible but I am very busy and cannot assure anything. 

Right now we have some basic features added but once I get the project managment system on github figured out more info on everything will be added there. 

This readme will also be updated soon as well. This is just here to get things going and help everyone understand the main plans. 

So far everything to expect if you want to put any of this to use:

Unity Version: 6000.0.40f1

Current Features:

- Basic FPS functions (WASD, Sprint, Crouch)
- NoClip
- (Sorta) Functioning Gravity Gun from HL2
  
     Gravgun Abilities:
        - Debugging Features
        - Pull objects using Right Click (must hold)
        - Lock Object in place (literally) with Left Click
        - Throw Objects by left clicking again while object is held. (Need to add drop function)
        - Rotate Object using Q,E, and Scroll while being held in place
  
- Modular Weapon system (in progress)
- Ability to pick up Gravgun and Drop

So far that is all that is added that I can remember right now. I'm not sure where I'm going to go next with it, but everything will be updated here and on the discord. Most of the live activity
will be able to be seen at the discord. I will probably go live in chat sometimes and get feedback from you guys directly or just to simply hang out. 

Now enough rambling, lol. I will update this later like I said.
